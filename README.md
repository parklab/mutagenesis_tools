# mutagenesis_tools

The scripts in this repository can be used to simulate protein sequences from DNA, recode DNA with nonsynonymous or synonymous variants, and in general mutagenize a sequence *in silico*. 

This repository implements `blast_tools` and can be paired with `sv_gene_analysis` to carry out fusion/chimeric protein sequence analysis and neoantigen identification (for SNVs, indels, and fusions)
