# mutagenesis_tools

The scripts in this repository can be used to simulate protein sequences from DNA, recode DNA with nonsynonymous or synonymous variants, and in general mutagenize a sequence *in silico*. The ideal applications are for:

1. Simulating SNV/indel and SV-fusion mutant sequences (genomic and transcriptomic), both nucleotide and amino acid.
3. Matching a peptide or protein sequence back to a mutant nucleotide of interest (for example, in matching protein mass spectrometry hits to a nucleotide database)
  a. match a protein or peptide sequence back to nucleotide sequences in a FASTA. If custom sequences or a set of FASTAs are provided, then this script will also determine which sequence(s) are the unique peptide templates
